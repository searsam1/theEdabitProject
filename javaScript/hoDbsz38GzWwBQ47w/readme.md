# FizzBuzz Interview Question
<br><br>
## Matt
<br><br>
### """Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".
If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be "Fizz".
If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz".
If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz".
If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.
The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5.
Try to be precise with how you spell things and where you put the capital letters.
