Store of Edabit Challenges.

For a couple years now I have been completing "edabit" challenges; edabit challenges are functions that one must create in order to solve a particular problem given in the instructions. As of April 29th, 2022, I am only recording the python ones that I solve. Edabit also comes in a variet of flavors you see; each challenge has multiple langs that it can be solved in. I am only including the python ones here because my spider that I created only knows how to scrape python syntax. They also come in differnt diffuculty levels, but for sake of simplicty I will be condensing them all here in theEdabitProject /Python repository. 





## The Fastest Way To Learn
""" Everyone knows the fastest way to learn a spoken language is by having conversations with native speakers. 
Likewise, the fastest way to learn to code is by actually coding. 
Edabit offers an almost limitless supply of bite-sized exercises, so you can rapidly advance your abilities. """

## The Easiest Way To Learn
""" Do you feel like youâ€™re stuck between learning material thatâ€™s too easy and material thatâ€™s too hard?
Once the basics are learned, you will realize everything is made for either a total beginner or an advanced coder.
Edabit bridges this gap. You start on easy and progress at your own pace until you're able to master the toughest coding exercises.
