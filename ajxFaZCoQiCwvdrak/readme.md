# Shapes With N Sides
<br><br>
## Matt
<br><br>
### """Create a function that takes a whole number as input and returns the shape with that number's amount of sides. Here are the expected outputs to get from these inputs.
There won't be any tests with a number below 1 or greater than 10.
Return the output in lowercase.
The challenge is intended to be completed without conditionals (it would take too long)!"""
