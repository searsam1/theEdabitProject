### """The factorial of a positive number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
The semifactorial (also known as the double factorial) of a positive number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n that have the same parity (i.e. odd or even) as n.
The alternating factorial of a positive number n is the sum of the consecutive factorials from n to 1, where every other factorial is multiplied by -1.
Alternating factorial of 1:
Alternating factorial of 2:
Alternating factorial of 3:
Create a function that takes a number n and returns the difference between the alternating factorial and semifactorial of n.
