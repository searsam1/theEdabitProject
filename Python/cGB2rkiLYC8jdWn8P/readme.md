# Digits Battle!

### """Starting from the left side of an integer, adjacent digits pair up in "battle" and the larger digit wins. If two digits are the same, they both lose. A lone digit automatically wins.
Create a function that returns the victorious digits.
To illustrate:
There are no winners in a battle with equal digits (neither should be printed).
If the length of the number is odd, the lone digit should be printed at the end of the number."""
