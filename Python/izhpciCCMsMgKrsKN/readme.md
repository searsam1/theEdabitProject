# Dead End Number Sequence

### """This number sequence can start with any positive integer n. s is the sum of the individual digits in n. If s divides into n evenly then the next term of the series is n//s. Otherwise the next term is n*s. Eventually the series will reach a dead end with two numbers alternating: 58, 754, 12064, 928, 17632, 928, 17632. This series has a length of 5 with 17632 as the last term.
Compose a function that takes a positive integer and returns its series length and its last term.
