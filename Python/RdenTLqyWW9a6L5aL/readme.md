### """A number is said to be Harshad if it's exactly divisible by the sum of its digits. Create a function that determines whether a number is a Harshad or not.
You are expected to solve this challenge via recursion.
You can check on the Resources tab for more details about recursion.
An iterative version of this challenge can be found via this  link."""

```is_harshad(75) ➞ False
# 7 + 5 = 12
# 75 is not exactly divisible by 12

is_harshad(171) ➞ True
# 1 + 7 + 1 = 9
# 9 exactly divides 171
