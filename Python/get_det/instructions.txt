In linear algebra, the determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix.Create a function that takes a square list as an argument and returns a number (determinant).
~Examples~
get_det([ [ 0, 1], [ 1, 1] ]) ➞ -1 get_det([ [69, 0], [1, 1] ]) ➞ 69 get_det([ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] ]) ➞ 0
