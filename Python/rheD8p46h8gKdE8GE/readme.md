# Image Manipulation: 255 Shades of Grey (Part 2)
<br><br>
## Matt

### """Images can be described as 3D lists.
Your task is to create a function that takes a 3D list representation of an image and returns the grayscale version of that.
A valid RGB value ranges from 0 to 255 (inclusive).
If the given list contains out of bound values, convert them to the nearest valid one.
Grayscaling an image is adjusting to have the same amount of (Red, Green, Blue) from their combined average to produce different shades of gray. """
