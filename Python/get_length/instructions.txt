Python's len() method will return the number of elements in a list. For example, the list below contains 2 elements:[1, [2, 3]] # 2 elements, number 1 and list [2, 3]Suppose we instead wanted to know the total number of non-nested items in the nested list. In the above case, [1, [2, 3]] contains 3 non-nested items, 1, 2 and 3.Create a function that returns the total number of non-nested items in a nested list.
~Examples~
get_length([1, [2, 3]]) ➞ 3 get_length([1, [2, [3, 4]]]) ➞ 4 get_length([1, [2, [3, [4, [5, 6]]]]]) ➞ 6 get_length([1, [2], 1, [2], 1]) ➞ 5
~Notes~
An empty list should return 0.
