Time to call your lover to inform him/her what he/she lost in the burglary.Given a dictionary of the stolen objects, return the 3rd most expensive item on the list. If that is not possible, because there are not enough items, return False.
~Examples~
third_most_expensive({}) ➞ False # Items are less than three. third_most_expensive({"piano": 100, "stereo": 200 }) ➞ False # Items are less than three. third_most_expensive({"piano": 100, "stereo": 200, "tv": 10, "timmy": 500 }) ➞ "piano" # 'piano' is the third most expensive item.
~Notes~
All prices will be of different monetary values.
