In the game Set, three cards form a set if each of the cards are identical or completely different for each of the four properties. All three cards must:Have the same color or different colors.Have the same number or different numbers.Have the same shades or different shades.Have the same shape or different shapes.The four properties are:Colors: red, purple, greenNumbers: 1, 2, 3Shades: empty, lined, fullShapes: squiggle, oval, diamondHere, a set is represented by an array containing three cards. Each card is represented by an object of properties and values. Write a function that determines whether three cards constitute a valid set.Here is an example of a set:[ { "color": "red", "number": 1, "shade": "empty", "shape": "squiggle" }, { "color": "red", "number": 2, "shade": "lined", "shape": "diamond" }, { "color": "red", "number": 3, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" } ] # "Same" properties: color # "Different" properties: numbers, shading and shapesThe following is not a set:[ { "color": "red", "number": 1, "shade": "empty", "shape": "squiggle" }, { "color": "red", "number": 2, "shade": "lined", "shape": "diamond" }, { "color": "purple", "number": 3, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" } ] # Colors are not all identical, but not all different.
~Examples~
is_set([ { "color": "green", "number": 1, "shade": "empty", "shape": "squiggle" }, { "color": "green", "number": 2, "shade": "empty", "shape": "diamond" }, { "color": "green", "number": 3, "shade": "empty", "shape": "oval" } ]) ➞ True is_set([ { "color": "purple", "number": 1, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" }, { "color": "green", "number": 1, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" }, { "color": "red", "number": 1, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" } ]) ➞ True is_set([ { "color": "purple", "number": 3, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" }, { "color": "green", "number": 1, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" }, { "color": "red", "number": 3, "shade": "full", "shape": "oval" } ]) ➞ False
~Notes~
A set cannot have 2/3 cards having the same property. Either all must share that property, or none will share that particular property.You can play Set by checking the Resources tab.
