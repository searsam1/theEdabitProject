arraysloopsmathstringsvalidation happy number is a number which yields a 1 by repeatedly summing up the square of its digits. If such a process results in an endless cycle of numbers containing 4, the number is said to be an unhappy number.Create a function that accepts a number and determines whether the number is a happy number or not. Return True if so, False otherwise.
~Examples~
is_happy(67) ➞ False is_happy(89) ➞ False is_happy(139) ➞ True is_happy(1327) ➞ False is_happy(2871) ➞ False is_happy(3970) ➞ True
~Notes~
Hint: Your loop terminates if the value of n is either 1 or 4.Alternatively, you can solve this challenge via a recursive approach.A recursive version of this challenge can be found via this link.
