The factorial of a positive number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120The semifactorial (also known as the double factorial) of a positive number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n that have the same parity (i.e. odd or even) as n.12!! = 12 x 10 x 8 x 6 x 4 x 2 = 46,080 7!! = 7 x 5 x 3 x 1 = 105The alternating factorial of a positive number n is the sum of the consecutive factorials from n to 1, where every other factorial is multiplied by -1.Alternating factorial of 1:af(1) = 1!Alternating factorial of 2:af(2) = 2! + (-1)x(1!) = 2! - 1! = 2 -1 = 1Alternating factorial of 3:af(3) = 3! - 2! + 1! = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5Create a function that takes a number n and returns the difference between the alternating factorial and semifactorial of n.
