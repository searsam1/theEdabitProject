# Double Palindromes

### """Strings can be segregated into both their letter and digit components.
A double palindrome is when a string's letter component and digit component are both palindromes.
A single-palindrome is when either (but not both) the letter component or the digit component are palindromes.
To illustrate:
Write a function that maps double palindromes to the number 2, single palindromes to the number 1, and everything else to the number 0.
A string is composed of only letters or only numbers, can be at most a single palindrome (see example #2).
All single character components are trivially palindromes (see example #3).
All letters will be lower cased."""

```"cab97ac79"
# double-palindrome: "cabac" and "9779" are both palindromes.

"1abc4de1"
# single-palindrome: "141" is a palindrome.
