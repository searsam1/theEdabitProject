ation of any smaller number.  869 is not a new number because it is just a -
permutation of smaller numbers, 689 and 698. 509 is a new number because it-
 can't be formed by a permutation of any smaller number (leading zeros not -
allowed).Write a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns Tru-
e if the integer is a new number and False if it is not.Examplesis_new(3) ➞-
