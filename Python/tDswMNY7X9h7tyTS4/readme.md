In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that arises in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.

Formula for Pascal's triangle is given by:

where n denotes a row of the triangle, and k is the position of a term in the row.
Create a function which takes a number n and returns n top rows of Pascal's Triangle flattened into a one-dimensional list.
