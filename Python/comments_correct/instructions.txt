In JavaScript, there are two types of comments:Single-line comments start with //Multi-line or inline comments start with /* and end with */The input will be a sequence of //, /* and */. Every /* must have a */ that immediately follows it. To add, there can be no single-line comments in between multi-line comments in between the /* and */.Create a function that returns True if comments are properly formatted, and False otherwise.
~Examples~
comments_correct("//////") ➞ True # 3 single-line comments: ["//", "//", "//"] comments_correct("/**//**////**/") ➞ True # 3 multi-line comments + 1 single-line comment: # ["/*", "*/", "/*", "*/", "//", "/*", "*/"] comments_correct("///*/**/") ➞ False # The first /* is missing a */ comments_correct("/////") ➞ False # The 5th / is single, not a double //
