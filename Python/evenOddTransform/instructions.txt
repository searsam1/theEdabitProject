	Published by Helen Yu in C++LanguagesC++JavaScriptPythonRubySwift

arrayscontrol_flowloopsCreate a function that performs an even-odd transform to an array, n times. Each even-odd transformation:Adds two (+2) to each odd integer.Subtracts two (-2) from each even integer.
~Examples~
evenOddTransform([3, 4, 9], 3) ➞ [9, -2, 15] // Since [3, 4, 9] => [5, 2, 11] => [7, 0, 13] => [9, -2, 15] evenOddTransform([0, 0, 0], 10) ➞ [-20, -20, -20] evenOddTransform([1, 2, 3], 1) ➞ [3, 0, 5]
