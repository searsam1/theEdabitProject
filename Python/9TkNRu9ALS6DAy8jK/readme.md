# Find Highest Occurrence

### """Create a function that takes a list, finds the most repeated element(s) within it and returns it/them in a list. The function should work for both integers and strings mixed together within the input list (e.g. [1, 1, "a"]).
If there is a tie for highest occurrence, return both (see second example above).
Don't let integers become strings and/or string become integers in the result.
If returning multiple elements, sort result alphabetically with numbers coming before strings."""
