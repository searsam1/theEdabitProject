# Self-Descriptive Numbers

### """The number 10213223 is self-descriptive. Count the number of zeros, ones, twos, and threes that are contained in this number and you have 1 zero, 2 ones, 3 twos, 2 threes, but that is a replica of the number itself 10|21|32|23.
Write a function that returns True if its argument is a self-descriptive number, False if not.
Since the number's descriptors are always in pairs, any self-descriptive number must have an even number of digits.
The largest self-descriptive number possible is reportedly 71322723161814151019 (see Resources tab)."""
