Each letter in a sentence is worth its position in the alphabet (i.e. a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc...). However, if a word is all in UPPERCASE, the value of that word is doubled.Create a function which returns the value of a sentence.get_sentence_value("abc ABC Abc") ➞ 24 # a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 # abc = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 # ABC = (1+2+3) * 2 = 12 (ALL letters are in uppercase) # Abc = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 (NOT ALL letters are in uppercase) # 6 + 12 + 6 = 24
~Examples~
get_sentence_value("HELLO world") ➞ 176 get_sentence_value("Edabit is LEGENDARY") ➞ 251 get_sentence_value("Her seaside sea-shelling business is really booming!") ➞ 488
~Notes~
Ignore spaces and punctuation.Remember that the value of a word isn't doubled unless all the letters in it are uppercase.
