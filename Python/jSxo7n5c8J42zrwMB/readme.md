### """For math class, Matt needs to find out if a shape can fit inside another shape, based solely on their area. The only problem is, HE SUCKS AT MATH! He has asked you, his older brother, to make a program that will answer all his math questions.
Write a function that takes two shapes, with different inputs, and returns True if the second shape has an area smaller than the first.
The inputs will be in a standardized format per shape:
"Circle, radius"
"Triangle, Base, Height"
"Rectangle, Width,  Length (if different than Width) "
"Pentagon, Side"
Remember, the first item in each string will be the name of the shape, and all relevant data will be provided following said name."""
