# Image Manipulation: Invert (Part 1)

### """Images can be described as a 3D list.
Your task is to create a function that takes a 3D list representation of an image and returns the inverse of that.
For example, white becomes black, black becomes white, etc.
A valid RGB value ranges from 0 to 255 (inclusive).
If the given list contains out of bound values, convert them to the nearest valid one."""
