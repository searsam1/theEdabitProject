# Musical Instrument Note Ranges
<br><br>
## Joshua Señoron
<br><br>
### """Musical instruments have a range of notes to play, some instruments having a much larger range than others.
Given the following ranges for the instrument, create a function that returns True if a given note is within a given instrument's range. Otherwise, return False.
Tests will only include natural notes (i.e. you will only deal with letters and numbers, no special characters).
The musical scale follows this pattern:  ... A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, A2, B2 ...
You don't need to worry about invalid inputs."""
