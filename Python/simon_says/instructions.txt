Simon asks you to perform operations on a list of numbers that only he tells you. You should ignore all other instructions given. Create a function which evaluates a list of commands (written in plain English) if the command begins with Simon says. Return the result as an integer.
~Examples~
simon_says([ "Simon says add 4", "Simon says add 6", "Then add 5" ]) ➞ 10 simon_says([ "Susan says add 10", "Simon says add 3", "Simon says multiply by 8" ]) ➞ 24 simon_says([ "Firstly, add 4", "Simeon says subtract 100" ]) ➞ 0
~Notes~
If no instructions are given by Simon, return 0.For the sake of simplicity, there will be no command for dividing.
