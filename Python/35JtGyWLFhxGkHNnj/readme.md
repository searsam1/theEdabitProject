# Selective List Reversal
<br><br>
## Matt
<br><br>
### """Create a function that takes a list and a number and selectively reverse the order of the list based on the number you're given (second argument). If you're given the arguments [1,2,3,4,5,6] and 2, you would return the list [2,1, 4,3, 6,5].
If the list you're given can't be broken up into equal parts, just reverse the remaining numbers (see 2nd expample).
If  length exceeds the list length, reverse everything.
If  length is zero, return the original list."""

```sel_reverse([1,2,3,4,5,6], 2) ➞ [2,1, 4,3, 6,5]

sel_reverse([2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16], 3) ➞ [6,4,2, 12,10,8, 16,14]

sel_reverse([5,7,2,6,0,4,6], 100) ➞ [6,4,0,6,2,7,5]
