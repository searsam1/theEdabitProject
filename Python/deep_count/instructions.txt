Create a function that takes a list and returns the number of ALL elements within it (including those within the sub-level list(s)).
~Examples~
deep_count([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 3 deep_count([[1], [2], [3]]) ➞ 6 deep_count(["x", "y", ["z"]]) ➞ 4 deep_count(["a", "b", ["c", "d", ["e"]]]) ➞ 7
~Notes~
In the examples above, notice how the sub-lists within the main list count as an element as well as the elements within that sub-list.
