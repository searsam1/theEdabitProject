Given a string text. Write a function that returns the character with the highest frequency. If more than 1 character has the same highest frequency, return all those characters as an array sorted in ascending order. If there is no repetition in characters, return "No Repetition".
~Examples~
max_occur("Computer Science") ➞ ['e'] max_occur("Edabit") ➞ "No Repetition" max_occur("system admin") ➞ ['m', 's'] max_occur("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") ➞ [' ']
~Notes~
Try to make use of the concept used in counting sort.
