An ice cream sandwich is a string that is formed by two identical ends and a different middle.Some examples of ice cream sandwiches:"AABBBAA" "3&&3" "yyyyymmmmmmmmyyyyy" "hhhhhhhhmhhhhhhhh"Notice how left and right ends of the sandwich are identical in both length and in repeating character). The middle section is distinctly different.Not ice cream sandwiches:"BBBBB" // You can't have just plain icecream. "AAACCCAA" // You can't have unequal sandwich ends. "AACDCAA" // You can't have more than one filling. "A" // You can't have fewer than 3 characters.Write a function that returns True if a string is an ice cream sandwich and False otherwise.
~Examples~
is_icecream_sandwich("CDC") ➞ True is_icecream_sandwich("AAABB") ➞ False is_icecream_sandwich("AA") ➞ False
~Notes~
An ice cream sandwich must have a minimum length of 3 characters, and at least two of these characters must be distinct (you can't only have the filling!).
