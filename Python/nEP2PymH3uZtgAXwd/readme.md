### """This is a reverse coding challenge. Normally you're given explicit directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.
Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produce the sample outputs shown.
If you get stuck, see Comments for a hint."""
