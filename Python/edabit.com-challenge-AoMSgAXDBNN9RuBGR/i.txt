The Farm ProblemPublished by Helen Yu in PHPLanguagesC++C#JavaJavaScriptPHP-
PythonRubySwiftTranslatealgorithmslanguage_fundamentalsmathIn this challeng-
e, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among al-
l his animals. The farmer breeds three species:chickens = 2 legscows = 4 le-
gspigs = 4 legsThe farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtot-
al for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the tota-
l number of legs of all the animals.Examplesanimals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

animals(-
1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50NotesDon't forget to return the result.-
The order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).Remember that -
the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and not the total number -
of animals.Watch a quick demo on how Edabit works.WATCH DEMO
