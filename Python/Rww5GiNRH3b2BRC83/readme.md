# Regex HTML Get Request Checker
<br><br>

<br><br>
### """You are to create a special regex that will detect if an HTML GET request is valid or not (with some gotchas). Strings are formated like so:
You need to detect requests with the four names: "val", "id", "desc", "time" (each value can have a different order).
Each name has a specific value:
val could contain  string a to z and number 0 to 9 (any case accepted).
id is a number from 0 to 10.
desc could contain strings a to z.
time is formated value (00:00 to 99:99).
When the regex checker is finished, you need to put all names and their values from the request into an object and return it with the given function data_regex_lovely(). The parameter txt is a valid GET request (no gotchas).
The regex length is limited to < 161 characters ( "/" and [flags] included).
You might get an empty string "" when users don't send a request.
Warning about data object value types."""
