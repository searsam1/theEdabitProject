Create a function that takes the memory size (MS is a string type) as an argument and returns the actual memory size.
~Examples~
actual_memory_size(32GB) ➞ 29.76GB actual_memory_size(2GB) ➞ 1.86GB actual_memory_size(512MB) ➞ 476MB
~Notes~
The actual storage loss on a USB device is 7% of the overall memory size!If the actual memory size was greater than 1 GB, round your result to two decimal places.If the memory size after adjustment is smaller then 1 GB, return the result in MB.For the purposes of this challenge, there are 1000 MB in a Gigabyte.
