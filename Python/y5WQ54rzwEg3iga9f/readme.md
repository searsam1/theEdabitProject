### """For this question, treat people as existing only on integers.
Two ice cream stands: A and B each occupy a spot on the beach, from [0, 100]. Their positions are represented with coordinates (A, B). One position could be:
People are distributed equally from [0, 100], and will purchase ice cream  from the stand closest to them.
For (A, B) above, we have that  everyone from[0, 50] goes to A and everyone from [51, 100] goes to B. People on 50 will go to A because |50 - 32| = 18 < 19 = |50 - 69|, and people on 51 will go to B because |51 - 69| = 18 < 19 = |51 - 32|.
Write a function that calculates the profit for each ice cream stand based on their position. For the example above,  profit(32, 69) = [51, 50].
Disregard ties. For instance, if (A, B) = (49, 51), disregard the person on 50. Profit is equally distributed in this case, with profit(49, 51) = [50, 50].
A < B will always be true.
A and B will never occupy the same spot."""
