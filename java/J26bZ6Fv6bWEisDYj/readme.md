### """Given the shortest side of a 30° by 60° by 90° triangle, find out the other two sides. Return the longest side and medium-length side in that order.
30° by 60° by 90° triangles always follow this rule: let's say the shortest side length is x units, the hypotenuse would be 2x units and the other side would be x * square root of 3.
The results in the Tests are rounded up to 2 decimal places.
Return the result as an array."""
