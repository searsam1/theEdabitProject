### """A new number is a number that is not a permutation of any smaller number.  869 is not a new number because it is just a permutation of smaller numbers, 689 and 698. 509 is a new number because it can't be formed by a permutation of any smaller number (leading zeros not allowed).
Write a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns True if the integer is a new number and False if it is not.
A curious fact: out of the first one million integers, only 8002 are new."""
