# Using the "&&" Operator
<br><br>
## bangyen
<br><br>
### """Ruby has a logical operator &&, which can also be written as and. The && operator takes two boolean values, and returns true if both values are true.
Consider a && b:
a is checked if it is true or false.
If a is false,  false is returned.
b is checked if it is true or false.
If b is false, false is returned.
Otherwise, true is returned (as both a and b are therefore true ).
The && operator will only return true for true && true.
Make a function using the && operator.
