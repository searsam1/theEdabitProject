# String to Phone Number
<br><br>

### """You're able to call numbers like 1-800-flowers which replace the characters with the associated numbers on a cellular device keyboard.
This is your task:
Create a function that takes a string as argument.
Convert all letters to numbers by using a cellular device keyboard as reference and leave any other characters in.
Return a string containing the argument with replaced letters.
While when you would write a SMS back in the day, to enter "b", you would have to press "2" twice. When calling numbers this is not the case as the range a-c gets converted to "2".
Given string can contain upper and lowercase letters.
Enjoy and good luck!"""
