# Sum of Resistance in Parallel Circuits

### """If two or more resistors are connected in parallel, the overall resistance of the circuit reduces. It is possible to calculate the total resistance of a parallel circuit by using this formula:

Create a function that takes an array of parallel resistance values, and calculates the total resistance of the circuit.
Note that you should rearrange to return the Resistance Total, not 1 / Resistance Total.
Round to the nearest decimal place.
All inputs will be valid."""

```ParallelResistance({6, 3, 6}) âžž 1.5

// 1/RTotal = 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/6
// 1/RTotal = 2/3
// RTotal = 3/2 = 1.5
```
