### """Create a function that validates whether a number n is  within the bounds of lower and upper. Return false if n is not an integer.
The term "within bounds" means a number is considered equal or greater than a lower bound and lesser (but not equal) to an upper bound, (see example #2).
Bounds will be always given as integers."""
