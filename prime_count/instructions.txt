Given two integers create a function that counts the number of primes between the two given integers.
~Examples~
prime_count(1, 10) ➞ 4 # range = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] # primes = [2, 3, 5, 7] # answer = 4 prime_count(1, 100) ➞ 25 prime_count(1, 1000) ➞ 168
~Notes~
If there are no primes within the given range, return 0.
